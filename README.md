  `$ git clone https://github.com/clovisdanielcosta/netflix-interface.git`

  2. On your browser install extension "Moesif Origin & CORS Changer" and turn on to be able to do requests from CoinMarketCap API.
  3. Run file "index.html".
  4. If my monthly requests limits was exceeded you will not be able to see the quotations. Then open an account on CoinMarketCap and insert the key on variable "key" on file "./js/main.js".

## :books: Learning
  - Better understanding about FETCH Requests.
  - Improving CSS skills.
  - Stumble with Moesif Origin & CORS for the first time.
  - Use of CoinMarketCap API for the first time.

## :small_orange_diamond: Customizing

  - Applied my own pattern of folders structure and filenames.

  - Applied color red for negative values on the Percentage changes.   
  - New requests of Ranking, Price, Volume and Percentage change of crypto currencies. 
  - Import logo images of each crypto coin.
  - And the most IMPORTANT: creation of new giant coin to put fun on this project a little bit      more. You will see it on this first position of list.
